<h2>Unique Paths</h2>
<p>This problem would give the user with an mxn grid and the user would have to find the number of unique paths that could be traveled. You could only move down and right.
    The path could be represented as a string of "rights" and "downs". You could calculate the number of unique permutations that could be made on the string.

<pre><code>
    import math

    class Solution:
        def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
            return int(math.factorial(m - 1 + n - 1) / (math.factorial(m - 1) * math.factorial(n - 1)))
